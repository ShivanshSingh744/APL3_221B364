public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test test = new Test();
        test.display();
    }
}
i need output like:-
Arjun is Bharatvanshi, Pandav, Fighter, Obedience and kind.
Arjun is Bharatvanshi, Pandav, Fighter, Obedience but not kind.
Duryodhan is Bharatvanshi, Kaurav, Fighter, disobedience.
Vikarn is Bharatvanshi, Kaurav, Fighter, Obedience and kind.

Make class bharatvanshi, with subclass kaurav and Pandav and have Duryodhan and vikarn is subclass of Kaurav and Arjun and Bheem is the subclass of Pandav. here Kindness is interface class.
